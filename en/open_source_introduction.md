## INTRODUCTION TO COLLABORATIVE DESIGN AND OPEN SOURCE

In Information Technology a software is referred to as "Open Source" when its source code is publicly available for programmers to change or extend. In simpler words, the "recipe" for a work is shared, free and everyone can use it.
What are the benefits of this? Collaborating and sharing your ideas with others makes it possible for them to be reinterpreted, continuously improved and used within broader contexts; in addition, you can reach far higher standards by joining forces than working alone. Making the source code open doesn't mean losing control over your work: the "inventor of the recipe" examines and chooses what can and cannot be added to his/her initial project.
Why are the ideas of Open Source and Collaborative Design important in the University, too? Take Moodle as an example, an Open Source platform that, in the last few years, became an essential academic tool for teaching and learning. Moodle gives you the opportunity to share material for lessons and exams in a quick and simple way; blogs and chats allow you to be constantly up to date and informed. Furthermore, quizzes and feedback systems offer an active learning experience where students and teachers can interact.

Collaborative Design also gives you the opportunity to create projects where anyone can share their specific expertise, knowledge and ideas in order to achieve the goals that the project itself aims to reach.
