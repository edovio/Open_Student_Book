# Scientific studies

Scientific studies are divided in three different areas, which are: Technology and Projecting, Human Health care, and the so called “Classic”.
The principal faculties of the technologic and planning area Engineering and IT(information technology), for the second  area we can find Medicine, Biology and Pharmacy, while for the third there are Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and so on.
The common point, which includes all these faculties, is a knowledge system achieved through an organised research and very methodics and pretty strict procedures, which have the purpose to describe objectively the rules controlling phenomenon. (un periodo un po' troppo lungo, con troppe riflessioni, non ho tradotto parola per parola perché anche in inglese era impossibile e ci sarebbero dovute essere un sacco di di sub-clauses)

## Technologic and Planning Area
The faculties of this area consist of a large range of different studies which vay from Energy to Mechanics, through the Environment and Territory and ends with Chemistry. The main university courses of the TP Area, which are converged in a collaborative planning and the creation of Open source projects, are Informatics, computer Engineering, electronics, Automation engineering, Engineering of energy and mechanics. All these course have their final/main goal the introduction of a specialised person involved in the making-project process with a work-team (anche qui, il periodo è troppo lungo e sebbene la frase sia abbastanza adeguata all’originale italiano, la cosa migliore da fare se si deve leggere in pubblico è scandire bene il ritmo della frase). For example, the project could be about the use of nuclear energy, the reactors, the fuel, or the creation of softwer commonly used for a nuclear power plant.

## Human Health Care
These faculties are centred to determine scientifically all the approaches, the behaviour, the material, the human body with the goal to ameliorate the human well-being. The open-source projecta decides the opportunity of develop new ideas in a collaborative way. Furthermore, thanks to multidisciplinarity (questa parola ha senso e allo stesso tempo difficile da afferrarne il concetto persino in italiano nel contesto d’insieme), this approach allow to develop new innovative technologies to the risolution of problems. This happens in different ways according to the complexity of the problem and ensuring the best efficiency and efficacy.

## Classic Sciences
CS are sciences which include physics, chemisry or mathematics. Their scientific approach is based on the theoretic study of a phenomenon in order to understand and explain it.

## Factors which are common the Collaborative planning (open source)

### Technologic and Planning Area
This is the first area that have implemented the concepts of open-source, free planning. The computer scientists have the possibility ti collaborate and develop the code of several programming languages on active projects. Furthermore they can promote the projects in order to empower the cultural level and realize easily a Portfolio. The same could be said for the rest of the TP Area.contributing and promoting the open-source projects allows to enrich the portfolio of the single computer scientist and consequently to participate to active projects, growing up their cultural level and their experiences. An example of community or developed products with an open-source approach are certainly Raspberry Pi (engineering area) and WordPress (Computer Area).

#### Food for thought
* OpenSource program development
* OpenSource hardware development
* Open and Free project development

### Human Health Care
Realising collaborative projects  allows to introduce new way of experimentation and increase theories developing specific communities which collaborate with each other freely. In addition, the specific and the multidisciplinar feature of this planning way permits to enriche the single and the common skills in order to finde easily solutions. For example: Coming Up Short Handed

#### Food for thought
* Healthcare innovative solution development open oriented
* New thesis and theory development
* Multidisciplinary and innovating project development

### Classic sciences
The realisation of experimentations and theory could be done in a better and easier way and create a community which will follow collaboratively the scientific path in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of those one more strongly through scientific datas. The multidisciplinar-planning affords to increase the singular and collective skills which can be helpful in the use of innovative technique in order to facilitate the demonstratuon of past and new theories. An example are all the distributed calculation or grid computing.

#### Food for thought
* Theorem development with open communities
* Test new theorem in a free and shared mode 
* Development of new theroem and tests with multidisciplinary communities
* Create new Project of distributed calculation or grid computing
